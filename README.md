# Project Idea: Fitness Tracker

## Description
Create a fitness tracker application that empowers users to meticulously log their workouts and nutrition. This comprehensive platform enables users to register, log in, and input detailed information about their exercises and meals. The application goes beyond mere data entry, offering visual representations of users' progress for a more engaging experience.

## Technologies Involved
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing user information, workout details, and nutrition data.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework handling server-side logic, routing, and API interactions.
- **React.js**: Frontend library for building a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for executing server-side code.
- **GitLab**: Version control system for meticulous tracking of code changes.
- **Heroku**: Cloud platform for seamless deployment and hosting of the application.

## Features to Include
1. **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login functionality.
2. **Workout Logging**: Enable users to log daily workouts, capturing exercise type, sets, reps, and weights.
3. **Nutrition Tracking**: Dedicated section for logging daily meals, including food type and nutritional information.
4. **Progress Visualization**: Utilize charts or graphs to visually represent users' fitness progress over time.
5. **Responsive Design**: Ensure accessibility and an appealing interface across various devices.
6. **Agile Development**: Divide the project into manageable tasks (user stories) and implement them through iterative sprints.

## Development Steps
1. Set up the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) on your local machine.
2. Develop the backend using Express.js and Node.js, implementing user authentication and database connections.
3. Create the frontend using React.js, integrating components for user registration, login, and the main dashboard.
4. Implement workout and nutrition logging functionalities.
5. Integrate charting libraries for effective progress visualization.
6. Utilize GitLab for version control, creating branches for different features and merging them upon completion.
7. Deploy the application on Heroku to make it accessible online.
