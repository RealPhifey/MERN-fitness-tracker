# Project Idea: Fitness Tracker

## Description
Create a fitness tracker application that empowers users to meticulously log their workouts and nutrition. This comprehensive platform enables users to register, log in, and input detailed information about their exercises and meals. The application goes beyond mere data entry, offering visual representations of users' progress for a more engaging experience.

## Technologies Involved
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing user information, workout details, and nutrition data.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework handling server-side logic, routing, and API interactions.
- **React.js**: Frontend library for building a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for executing server-side code.
- **GitLab**: Version control system for meticulous tracking of code changes.
- **Heroku**: Cloud platform for seamless deployment and hosting of the application.

## Features to Include
1. **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login functionality.
2. **Workout Logging**: Enable users to log daily workouts, capturing exercise type, sets, reps, and weights.
3. **Nutrition Tracking**: Dedicated section for logging daily meals, including food type and nutritional information.
4. **Progress Visualization**: Utilize charts or graphs to visually represent users' fitness progress over time.
5. **Responsive Design**: Ensure accessibility and an appealing interface across various devices.
6. **Agile Development**: Divide the project into manageable tasks (user stories) and implement them through iterative sprints.

## Development Steps
1. Set up the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) on your local machine.
2. Develop the backend using Express.js and Node.js, implementing user authentication and database connections.
3. Create the frontend using React.js, integrating components for user registration, login, and the main dashboard.
4. Implement workout and nutrition logging functionalities.
5. Integrate charting libraries for effective progress visualization.
6. Utilize GitLab for version control, creating branches for different features and merging them upon completion.
7. Deploy the application on Heroku to make it accessible online.

## Learning Resources
- Refer to MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js documentation for in-depth understanding.
- Explore online tutorials dedicated to MERN stack development.
- Familiarize yourself with GitLab documentation for effective version control.
- Follow Heroku documentation for a seamless deployment process.

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thanks to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
